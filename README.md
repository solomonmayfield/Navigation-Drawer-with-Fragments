# Navigation-Drawer-with-Fragments
Navigation Drawer with Fragments Part 1 - MENU AND ACTIVITY THEME - Android Studio
In this little video series we are going to build a navigation drawer from scratch. When we click any of the menu items in our navigation drawer, we will switch between different fragments or trigger another action.

In part 1 we will add the dependency for the design support library and create the vector icons, as well as the menu xml file with a menu group and multiple menu items, which each have an id, a title and an icon set to them. We will also prepare our activity theme by removing the action bar with the windowActionBar and windowNoTitle attributes, so we can later add a toolbar instead.
